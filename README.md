# DBMAP
DBMAP stands for Database Mapping and Analysis Project. It demonstrates different techniques for handling, merging, and analyzing database-related data in R using data.table, ggplot2, and igraph.

The project consists of three levels of complexity:
	•	EASY: Basic data merging and visualization.
	•	MEDIUM: Advanced data manipulation with missing value handling and multi-table joins.
	•	HARD: Database schema visualization using graph structures.
