#HARD Approach

 Concepts Used:
	•	Graph-based Database Schema Representation
	•	Using igraph for relationship mapping
	•	Computing network metrics (degree, betweenness)
	•	Customizing graph appearance (node size, color, layout)

 Files Included:
	•	HARD/HARD_SOL.Rmd – R Markdown file
	•	HARD/HARD_SOL.pdf – Compiled PDF file

 Output:
	•	Visualizes database schema relationships as a graph.
	•	Highlights important nodes based on their connectivity.
	•	Uses Kamada-Kawai layout for better structure.
