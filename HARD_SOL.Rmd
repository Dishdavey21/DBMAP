```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


## **Step 1: Install & Load Packages**
```{r}
library(igraph)
library(data.table)
```

## **Step 2: Define Schema Relationships as a Graph**
```{r}
edges <- data.table(from = c("Customers", "Orders", "Orders", "Payments", "Products"),
                    to = c("Orders", "Payments", "Products", "Refunds", "Suppliers"))

# Convert into Graph Structure
graph <- graph_from_data_frame(edges, directed = TRUE)
```

## **Step 3: Compute Network Metrics**
```{r}
node_degree <- degree(graph, mode = "all")  # Total connections (in + out)
betweenness_values <- betweenness(graph)  # Centrality measure
```

## **Step 4: Add Node Attributes (Size, Color)**
```{r}
V(graph)$size <- node_degree * 5 + 15  # Adjust size based on degree
V(graph)$color <- ifelse(node_degree > 2, "red", "lightblue")  # Highlight key nodes
V(graph)$label <- V(graph)$name  # Display table names
```

## **Step 5: Plot the Enhanced Graph with Advanced Layout**
```{r}
set.seed(42)  # Ensures consistent layout
plot(graph, 
     layout = layout_with_kk(graph),  # Kamada-Kawai layout for better structure
     vertex.size = V(graph)$size,  
     vertex.color = V(graph)$color, 
     vertex.label.cex = 1.2, 
     edge.arrow.size = 0.7, 
     edge.color = "darkgrey",
     main = "Advanced Database Schema Representation")
```
